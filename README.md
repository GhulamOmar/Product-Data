SQL Query and Filtering Program for Product Data

Description:
The SQL Query and Filtering Program, developed by Omar Ahmad, is a C# application designed to interact with a database and perform specific data retrieval operations. This program operates on Windows 8.1 and was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. It serves as a practical implementation of SQL statements and data filtering techniques, aligning with concepts taught in the CIS 169 C# course.

Key Features:

Database Interaction: The program connects to a database named "productDBDataSet" and loads data from the "Product" table. This allows users to work with real product data.

Sort by Price: By clicking the "Sort by Price" button, users can execute an SQL query that retrieves all rows from the database and sorts them in ascending order based on the "price" column.
